/ All arrays are lists. A list of atoms of the same type is a vector.

An x \times y matrix is a list of x vectors of length y, all of the same type. A matrix has rank 2: it has two dimensions.

The rank of an array is the depth to which it is rectangular.

Rank and syntaxÂ¶
The rank of a value is the number of

arguments it evaluates, if it is a function
indexes required to select an atom, if it is a list or dictionary
A value is variadic if it can be used with more than one rank. All matrixes and some derived functions are variadic.


q)+/[til 5]           / unary
10
q)+/[1000000;til 5]   / binary
1000010
Rank is a semantic property, and is independent of syntax. This is a ripe source of confusion
