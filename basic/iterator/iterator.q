 Iterators
The iterators are unary operators. They take values as arguments and derive functions that apply them repeatedly.

Value

An applicable value is a q object that can be indexed or applied to one or more arguments:

function: operator, keyword, lambda, or derived function
list: vector, mixed list, matrix, or table
dictionary
file- or process handle
